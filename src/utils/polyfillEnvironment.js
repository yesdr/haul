// HACK:
//   This is horrible.  I know.  But this hack seems to be needed due to the way
//   React Native lazy evaluates `fetch` within `InitializeCore`.  This was fixed
//   in 34-ish, but seems to be back again.  I hope I'm wrong because I lost sleep
//   on this one.
//
//   Without this in place, global.fetch will be undefined and cause the symbolicate
//   check to fail.  This must be something that the packager is doing that haul isn't.
//   I also so people complaining about this in Jest as well.
